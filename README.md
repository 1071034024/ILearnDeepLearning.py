## Description

This repository contains small projects related to Neural Networks and Deep Learning in general. Subject are closely linekd with articles I publish on [Medium][1]. I encourage you both to read as well as to check how the code works in the action.

## Hit the ground running

``` bash
# clone repository
git clone https://github.com/SkalskiP/ILearnDeepLearning.py.git

# navigate to main directory
cd ILearnDeepLearning.py

# set up and activate python environment
python3 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate

# install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
